# 🏨 Hotel Analysis Project

This project is a data analysis of hotel booking trends using Python and Jupyter Notebook. It involves cleaning, exploring, and visualizing booking data from multiple CSV files related to hotels, rooms, dates, and aggregated bookings.

## 📁 Project Structure

- `Hotel_analysis.ipynb` – Main analysis notebook
- `dim_date.csv` – Date dimension table
- `dim_hotels.csv` – Hotel information
- `dim_rooms.csv` – Room details
- `fact_bookings.csv` – Raw booking records
- `fact_aggregated_bookings.csv` – Aggregated booking data
- `new_data_august.csv` – New booking data for August

## 🔍 Features

- Data loading and preprocessing
- Merging and cleaning datasets
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualizations of booking trends, revenue, room types, and occupancy rates
- Trend analysis and seasonal behavior

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
